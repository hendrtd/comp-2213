# Instructional Mode

The instructional mode for this course is 
[*Online Asynchronous*](http://auburn.edu/academic/provost/AU_Spring21_Modalities.pdf).
 In brief, this means that this course will be conducted online in its
entirety, and you will not have to be on campus for any part of this course.
There will be no class meetings for you to attend, and there will be no
specific time of day during which you have to participate in a course
activity. You will be responsible for setting your own schedule for completing
course readings, watching pre-recorded lecture videos, submitting assignments
and taking exams no later than the published deadlines, and completing all
other activities required by this course.

You are expected to have all the equipment and software needed to be
successful in this course. At a minimum, you must have a computer with a
webcam and microphone, and a broadband Internet connection capable of
installing and reliably running both

install and reliably run the software specific to this course as described
later in this syllabus. If you have needs regarding instructional technology,
you should contact the AU Bookstore at `books@auburn.edu`.

Times for all course events (assignment deadlines, exam times, etc.) will be
set in US [Central Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/ct). You are
responsible for meeting deadlines in Central Time regardless of what your
local time zone may be. You may find it helpful to follow the instructions
linked
[here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-set-a-time-zone-in-my-user-account-as-a-student/ta-p/414)
to have Canvas show deadlines appropriately in your local time zone to avoid
any confusion.
